The folders "delta", "gamma" and "iterative" contain the examples presented in ["Tighter Bounds on transient moments of stochastic chemical systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01309) (Holtorf and Barton, 2021) where different formulations of the moment bounding SDP as presented in the paper are employed for computation. While all formulations are theoretically equivalent in the sense that they have identical optimal values, i.e., furnish the same bounds, they may behave differently in practice due to numerical/scaling issues. In our experience the "delta"-formulation is the most robust, but suggest testing the other formulations in case numerical issues arise.
